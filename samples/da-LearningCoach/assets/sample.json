        "The \"Learning Coach\" is an open-source Copilot Agent designed to assist users in understanding complex terms or topics by providing explanations in simple terms. It offers three levels of summaries—simple, intermediate, and detailed—allowing users to choose the most suitable explanation for their knowledge gap. The agent can help users learn about specific topics, guide them in learning new languages, practice skills through exercises, prepare for tests, create learning plans, and suggest effective learning methods. It leverages OneDrive, SharePoint, and Graph Connectors to enhance its capabilities and streamline the learning process."
